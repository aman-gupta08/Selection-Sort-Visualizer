# Selection-Sort-Visualizer
In this project, I used to visualize Selection Sorting Algorithm using JavaScript. We will see how the elements are being sorted in Array and how they will be arranged.

Selection sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted array and swap it with element at beginning of unsorted array. 

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.


Approach:-

•	Button Generate New Array generates an array of random values using the Math.random() function and a bar corresponding to that value in terms of height.

•	Different colors are used to indicate which elements are unsorted(sky-blue), compared(darkblue & red) & sorted(lightgreen).

•	Button Selection Sort the elements using the selection sort algorithm.

•	Finally, elements are sorted.

Example: Click Generate New Array button to generate a new random array. Click the Selection Sort button to perform Visualization.
